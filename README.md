# csvconcat
Python recursive csv concatenator 

This is a super simple project that takes a path where csv files can be found, potentially deeply nested and concatenates them into a new file.

Headers are assumed to be the same across each file

Usage:
python3 csvconcat.py path-to-source-directory target-file-name
